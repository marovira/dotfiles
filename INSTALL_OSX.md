# OSX Installation

Download and install [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). Once that is done,
follow the same installation instructions for [linux](INSTALL_LINUX.md).

> **WARNING:**
> As of now, tmux will crash on start. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens,
> but it may just resolve itself eventually.
